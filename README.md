# weather-app
 project for a job interview 


This is a very simple web application. It used weatherbit.io's weather api to get its data.

To run this application:

1.) install node ( if you already have it skip this step)
2.) run npm run devStart
3.) go to localhost:8080 and you should be able to use my application

I had to submit it this way due to my webserver host not supporting node stuff on my current plan
